## Describe the growth of the digital economy
As we have seen the digital economy is growing and changing as time goes by, this growth is mainly associated with the internet and everything that implies a business model or having profits thanks to different platforms or pages that use the internet. Generally, this growth is characterized by:

- Users have the power of decision and information just clicks away. 
- Data or information grows and is generated so fast and is easy to obtain.
- Everyone can be connected thanks to a computer and the internet.
- Products or services are available anywhere in the world. 

However, the above is only the most general facets or capabilities that the digital transformation has had and that grew or became more popular thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, as there are other more interesting advances that are undoubtedly on another level. One of the simplest examples is the 5G network in smartphones, they may not seem so impressive, but the truth is that the 4G LTE network, the fastest currently in Mexico, had commercial deployment a decade ago. But the technologies that are most interesting and have the potential to become key pieces of technological development are those that are associated with artificial intelligence, distributed technology accounting (DTL) and quantum computing. Just a small proof of this is how AI is being used to monitor and predict the spread of Covid-19 in real time, but this is certainly only one of many fields where it can be applied. As for DTL the blockchain has become the most popular among financial markets as it allows to store data in such a way that it is almost impossible to falsify, finally with quantum computing it is expected to accelerate research and innovation in different fields such as agriculture, energy, aircraft manufacturing, etc. 


## Describe the ICT (Information and communication technologies) Indicators

Information technology indicators are essential for the creation of policies and strategies on the growth of ICTs in different fields, without forgetting that they must be accompanied by analysis and statistics to take better advantage of them. Although at first glance it may seem that they are only useful for ICT-related areas, the reality is that they are also useful for inclusion, social cohesion and for follow-up and evaluation of the impact of ICT on economic and social development. 

Some categories or approaches of these indicators are the following:
- Core indicators on ICT infrastructure and access.
- Core indicators on the ICT sector and trade in ICT goods.
- Core indicators on use of ICT by businesses.
- Core indicators on access to, and use of, ICT by households and individual.

## Identify and describe ICT-based business models
These are some of the basic business-based indicators:

- Proportion of businesses using computers: this point alludes to the utilization of PCs that an organization utilizes during a year time frame. Not forgetting that this can be both portable and non-portable, but not a small component such as smartphones.

- Proportion of employees using computers: This indicator refers to the proportion of employees using a computer in the company, that is, used for the employee's work over a 12-month period and not merely computer access. As with the previous indicator, smartphones or similar objects are not counted as computers.

- Proportion of businesses using the Internet: Refers to the use and access to the Internet in the company in a 12-month reference period, either through a computer or any smart device.

- Proportion of employees using the Internet: this indicator means the proportion of employees who used the Internet to perform their work in a 12-month period and not the simple fact of having access to the Internet.

- Proportion of businesses with a Web presence: Means the measure of the proportion of companies that have a presence on the Internet, that is, a domain and website and control over it.

- Proportion of businesses with an intranet: This indicator alludes to the proportion of companies that have an intranet, which is a network under the same protocol as the Internet allowing communication between the company.

## Explain strategic data analysis
* Collaboration with all stakeholders: A recommendation before starting any analysis or exploration of the data is to have good communication and working environment with all the interested parties to the project or objective, in order to benefit our analysis and vision of the project objective. 

* Make question	s: The simple fact of asking questions that direct us to the objective of our mission is one of the most important data analysis techniques because it provides the basis for the success of the analysis.   

* Data democratization: The reason for this strategy is to associate information from different sources in an effective and quick manner with the goal that anybody keen on the task can get to the information whenever and there are no potential issues in the workplace. 

* Integrate technology: A crucial decision is to integrate the technology and software to be used for the statistical method of data analysis. Choosing the right technology and software will avoid fragmentation of the knowledge obtained, which translates into savings of time and effort. 

## Describe ICT patents
Patents safeguard technological productions, i.e., products or processes that provide novel ways of doing something or novel technological resolutions to problems and play an important role in shaping the digital world. This is the reason why it is used as an indicator in the technological field and covers areas such as: 

* High-speed network. 

* High-speed computing. 

* Mobile communication. 

* Large-capacity information analysis. 

## Describe the impact in other areas: telecommunications, health, agriculture, science, energy.

The digital economy has had a great impact on the world from technology to life in the country, for better or for worse. Knowing this, let's talk about the field of telecommunications, this area has been one of the most affected on a large scale since as we know as the name says "Digital economy" everything is handled through digital, by technology, so Therefore, telecommunications were greatly affected in the infrastructure part since it is the only means by which the digital economy proliferates in the same way it had to be improved as software to have an optimized flow of all the information.

On the part of health, it has grown in a great way as the digital economy in the health sector has helped to improve all transactions in terms of machines, medicines as well as the flexibility of obtaining these, basically the most representative here is the ease of obtaining articles for the health sector. On the other hand, I have grown up in the field of creating bots or similar since there are some that are paid or like medical resources and their online store.

On agriculture it has impacted in the area of technology entry since this area had almost no access but what most affected or could affect was the fact that those who are in charge of the agricultural area can obtain their articles by means of digital, as we know previously they had to go to establishments or companies to obtain their articles for their area, now they only have to search digitally for what they need, in the same way it has helped the implementation of various types of resources for the improvement of this area such as field analysis, field studies, etc.

As far as science and energy we can say that it has basically helped in the optimization of obtaining resources, it is already bought of any kind through digital means, on the other hand we could say that it has affected in terms of energy use since when growing in the telecommunications field more energy is needed.


## Identify the historical stages of the development of technology.

Basically there are several "stages" for the development of the technology but we can see it in a more reduced way, for example:

Use of material
This phase is very difficult to consider as technology since for us technology is everything that involves things like robots, telephones, etc., even so, the first important step was the manufacture of tools for human use such as hammers, achas, etc.

Energy use
This phase involves several steps since, as we saw previously, it could cover the 1st and 2nd industrial revolutions since it is the beginning of the use of steam engines, fossil fuels, electricity.

Use of information
Finally we could say that this stage covers the 3rd and 4th industrial revolution since it is the beginning of the information age, what we call "technology", computers, telecommunications, etc.


## Identify the relevant indicators of the digital economy.


## Identify the impact of ICTs in other areas.
